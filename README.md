# Mathematics with Python
This is a basic script in Python language that solves some basic maths problems sucn as qudratic eqations, series, sets, distance and more  just in single second. This repo is very easy to use as I have tried to make it user friendly.
You can use any options to solve your mathematics problems by running main.py file. This repository contains a collection of Python scripts for solving various math problems. Each script is designed to perform a specific mathematical operation and can be run independently.
